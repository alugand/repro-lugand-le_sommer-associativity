# Replicability

## Factors

### Random Generator (generator branch)

We observe that the results are similar regardless of the random number generator used. In each of the experiments, we obtain a value between 0.74 and 0.75.

### Number type (number-type branch)

### Number of experiments (nbexp branch)

### Change language (python branch)
